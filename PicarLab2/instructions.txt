Running Instructions

First, run calibration to find correct timing values:

bash   python3 calibration.py

Update the timing values in robot_controller.py with your calibration results:

self.turn_90_duration
self.cell_forward_duration


Run the main navigation:

bash   python3 main_discrete_nav.py
Key Features

Modular design - Easy to modify individual components
Discrete 90Â° turns - More predictable than continuous steering
Safety checks - Emergency stop if obstacles detected
Limited actions per iteration - Rescans every 5 actions for better reactivity
Calibration script - Tune your specific robot's movement

Tuning Tips

Start with the calibration script to get base timings
Adjust EMERGENCY_STOP_CM based on your robot's stopping distance
Modify actions_executed >= 5 to control replanning frequency
Tune turn_power and forward_power for your surface type
